# Lua

## Syntax <!--{{{-->

Invoking the interpreter with a Lua file name parameter begins execution of the
file and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished,
the interpreter is no longer active.

Let us write a simple Lua program. All Lua files will have extension `.lua`.
So put the following source code in a `test.lua` file.

```lua
print("test")
```

Assuming, lua environment is setup correctly, letâ€™s run the program using the
following code:

    $ lua test.lua

Result:
    
    test

Let's try another way to execute a Lua program. Below is the modified
`test.lua` file

```lua
#!/usr/bin/env lua5.4
print("test")
```

Now, try to run this program as follows:

    $ chmod +x test.lua
    $ ./test.lua

Result:
    
    test

Lua also provides a mode called interactive mode. In this mode, you can type in
instructions one after the other and get instant results. This can be invoked
in the shell by using the `lua -i` or just the `lua` command. Once you type in
this, press Enter and the interactive mode will be started as shown below.

    $ lua
    Lua 5.4.4  Copyright (C) 1994-2022 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
    > 

You can print something using the following statement:

```lua
print("test")
```

Result:

    $ lua
    Lua 5.4.4  Copyright (C) 1994-2022 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
    > print("test")
    test
    >

### Tokens in Lua

A Lua program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an
identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the
following Lua statement consists of three tokens:

```lua
io.write("Hello world, from ", _VERSION, "!\n")
```

Result:

    Hello world, from Lua 5.4!
    file (0x7fb1521ef5a0)
